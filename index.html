                            <p>Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by Billie Eilish. It was released on July 30
                                2021, by Darksoom and Interscope Records. Billie wrote the album with her frequent
                                collaboration, her brother Finneas O'Connell, who produced the album himself. Billie
                                says the COVID-19 pandemic was her biggest inspiration for the album. Eilish has
                                revealed that the creative process of Happier Than Ever felt "very natural", unlike her
                                previous projects where she constantly felt anxious and under pressure.

                                In an interview with Vevo, Eilish said that she wanted to create "a very timeless
                                record", mostly being inspired by jazz singers that she listened to growing up such as
                                Julie London, Peggy Lee and Frank Sinatra.</p>

                            it. Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic,
